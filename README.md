Implementation of the paper: Singer, A., Zhao, Z., Shkolnisky, Y., &amp; Hadani, R. (2011). “Viewing angle classification of cryo-electron microscopy images using eigenvectors”. SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 4(2), 723-759.

# Motivation:
The algorithm in this paper is for identifying noisy cryo-EM images of nearby viewing angles. This identiﬁcation is an important ﬁrst step in 3D structure determination of macromolecules from cryo-EM, because once identiﬁed, these images can produce “class averages” of better quality.
